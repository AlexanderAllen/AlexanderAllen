### Hello,
<br/>

üëãüèΩ My name is Richard Allen (a.k.a Alexander Allen, he/him), I am a full stack developer.

ü¶ñ I started working with version 6 of Drupal in 2008 as a favor for some friends at the University of Puerto Rico and well, the rest feels like a blur...

üç∞ I just finished all major work on [Panettone](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/panettone), a PHP type generator for the Open Api Specification (OAS). I'd love to hear [your feedback](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/panettone/issues/new)!

üéµ I'm currently working on [M√∫sica](https://www.drupal.org/project/musica), a metadata discovery tool for music services.

<br />

### Hello,
<br/>

👋🏽 My name is Richard Allen (a.k.a Alexander Allen, he/him), I am a full stack developer.

🦖 I started working with version 6 of Drupal in 2008 as a favor for some friends at the University of Puerto Rico, and the well the rest feels like a blur...

🍰 I just finished all major work on [Panettone](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/panettone), a PHP type generator for the Open Api Specification (OAS). I'd love to hear [your feedback](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/panettone/issues/new)!

🎵 I'm currently working on [Música](https://www.drupal.org/project/musica), a metadata discovery tool for music services.

<br />

⚒️ Some of the previous, publicly available work I have done involve:
 - [Kubernetes](https://github.com/IBM/drupal-nginx-php-kubernetes/pull/93)
 - [TypeScript](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/vscode-gpg-indicator)
 - [Webpack / Electron / React](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/2019-electron-webpack-react-starter)
 - [Lando](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/Boilerplates-for-Lando)
 - [Docker](https://github.com/DrupalDevOps/Mirounga)

### Howdya doing ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard Allen. In here these parts my handle is Alexander Allen, but you can call me either. 

âš¡ I like to [ride bikes](https://legacy.usacycling.org/results/index.php?compid=640879), sometimes play [FTL](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/19fmcdp/ftl_multiverse_54_release_orchid_expansion_new), and love programming in general.

ðŸ”­ My latest projects are [Panettone](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/panettone) (an Open Api parser for PHP) and [Musica](https://www.drupal.org/project/musica) (a music service module for Drupal).

ðŸ’¬ You can find me at:

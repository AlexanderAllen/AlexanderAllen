### Hello,
<br/>

👋🏽 My name is Richard Allen (a.k.a Alexander Allen, he/him), I am a full stack developer. I mostly commit [tools](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/Boilerplates-for-Lando) [that](https://github.com/IBM/drupal-nginx-php-kubernetes/pull/93) [I](https://github.com/DrupalDevOps/Mirounga) [use](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/vscode-gpg-indicator) to help my clients or employers, but I'm starting to contribute stuff of my own just for fun.

🦖 I started working with version 6 of Drupal in 2008 as a favor for some friends at the University of Puerto Rico and well, the rest feels like a blur...

🍰 I just finished all major work on [Panettone](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/panettone), a PHP type generator for the Open Api Specification (OAS). I'd love to hear [your feedback](https://github.com/AlexanderAllen/panettone/issues/new)!

🎵 I'm currently working on [Música](https://www.drupal.org/project/musica), a metadata discovery tool for music services.

<br />

If you'd like a more detailed list of my previous projects and past experiences, [I recommend you check out my portfolio](portfolio.md).
